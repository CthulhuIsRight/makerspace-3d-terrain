        <h1>Step-by-Step Guide: 3D Printing a Scale Model of Mount Rainier</h1>
        <p>
            This project-based guide is designed for Pierce College geology courses and focuses on modeling height map topology using 3D printing. You'll learn how to generate a 3D printable STL file of a real-world landmark (like Mount Rainier in this tutorial's case) from elevation data, prepare it in slicer software, and produce a physical model. This hands-on process helps visualize geological features and topography for educational purposes.

                            <li>Decide on the geographical feature you want to 3D print.</li>
                            <li class="example">Example: Mount Rainier.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Open your web browser and navigate to <a href="https://jthatch.com/Terrain2STL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrain2STL</a>.</li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Define the Location (Northwest Corner):</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Terrain2STL, under the "<strong>Location</strong>" tab, specify the coordinates for the Northwest (NW) corner of the area you want to model. You can find these using online mapping tools (like Google Maps; right-click on a point to see its coordinates).</li>
                            <li class="example">For Mount Rainier:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Latitude: <code>46.9690</code></li>
                                    <li>Longitude: <code>-121.9186</code></li>
                                </ul>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Set Model Area Dimensions (Box Size):</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to the "<strong>Model Details</strong>" tab.</li>
                            <li>Define the "Box Width" (degrees of longitude) and "Box Height" (degrees of latitude) for your desired capture area.</li>
                            <li class="note"><strong>Note on "Square" Models:</strong> To get a geographically square area on the Earth's surface (not just a square selection box on the screen), the Box Width (longitude) needs to be greater than the Box Height (latitude) by a factor related to <code>cosine(latitude_of_your_area)</code>. This is because degrees of longitude get shorter as you move away from the equator.</li>
                            <li class="example">For your Mount Rainier model, aiming for a square footprint:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Box Width: <code>0.32</code> degrees</li>
                                    <li>Box Height: <code>0.22</code> degrees</li>
                                </ul>

                        <h3>Review Other Model Detail Settings (Important!):</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before generating, click the "<strong>Instructions / Model Details</strong>" tab in Terrain2STL and understand what each setting does. While you didn't change defaults this time, these are crucial for customizing your model, if you want to make any changes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Vertical Scaling/Exaggeration:</strong> Makes mountains appear more dramatic or flatter. A value of <code>1</code> is true to scale; values <code>1.5</code>-<code>2.5</code> exaggerate the terrain for a more dramatic effect, while values <code>&lt;1</code> flatten the terrain, making elevation differences less pronounced.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Base Height:</strong> Adds a solid base underneath the terrain. Essential for a printable model.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Water Drop / Sea Level:</strong> If your area includes water, this can create a flat surface for water bodies.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Model Size in Print Bed (mm):</strong> Terrain2STL can pre-scale the model.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="example">For this specific print, you can keep these at their default values.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Once you're satisfied with your location and settings, click the "<strong>Generate Model!</strong>" button. This may take a few moments depending on the complexity and size of the area.</li>
                        </ul>

                        Choosing to print by yourself means you'll handle the entire 3D printing process, from preparing your digital model to operating the printer and finishing the final product. This approach gives you full control over print settings, materials, and quality, but also requires familiarity with slicing software, printer operation, and troubleshooting common issues. It's a rewarding way to learn about 3D printing and customize your results.

                                    <strong>What is a slicer?</strong> A slicer is a program that takes your 3D model (like the STL file you downloaded) and converts it into instructions (G-code) that your 3D printer understands. It "slices" the model into thin horizontal layers and determines how the printer will build each layer.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Open <strong>PrusaSlicer</strong> (the slicer software used in this example). You can also use other slicer software such as Cura, SuperSlicer, or OrcaSlicer—the steps are similar amongst all slicer softwares.</li>
                                    <li>Import the <code>.stl</code> file you just extracted.</li>

                                        <li>Orient the model on the build plate for optimal printing (often flat on its base, with the sides parallel to the sides of the build plate).</li>

                                        <li>Click the "<strong>Slice</strong>" button in your software. The slicer converts your 3D model into a series of thin layers and generates the toolpaths (G-code commands) your printer will follow. This step also gives you an estimate of print time and material usage.</li>

                                <li>Ensure your printer bed is level and clean to promote good first-layer adhesion.</li>
                                <li>Double-check that you have PLA filament loaded, as the slicer settings were configured for it.</li>
                                <li>Pre-heat the nozzle and bed to the temperatures you set in PrusaSlicer (e.g., 217°C nozzle, 63°C bed).</li>

                                <li>3D printing often involves trial and error. If you encounter issues (e.g., poor adhesion, stringing, warping), you will need to diagnose the problem.</li>
                                <li class="example">If you run into problems, don't worry—these are common issues. Try searching for your specific problem online (e.g., "3D print not sticking to bed"), check your slicer settings, and consult online communities (like Reddit's /r/3Dprinting) or your printer's documentation. Documenting what you tried and the results can help you troubleshoot more effectively.</li>

                                <li>Once the print is finished and the bed has cooled (if necessary), carefully remove your model. It should peel off without excessive force.</li>

                            <li><strong>Sanding:</strong> To smooth out layer lines, if any are visible.</li>

                            <li><strong>Filling Gaps:</strong> Use filler putty or epoxy to fill in small gaps or imperfections before painting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Applying Decals:</strong> Add custom decals or labels for names, elevations, or other details.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adding a Protective Coating:</strong> Use clear spray or varnish to protect the paint and surface.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mounting or Framing:</strong> Attach your model to a wooden base, frame, or display case for presentation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Labeling:</strong> Add a plaque or printed label with the landmark name and details.</li>

## Introduction/Project Overview
This project-based guide is designed for Pierce College geology courses and focuses on modeling height map topology using 3D printing. You'll learn how to generate a 3D printable STL file of a real-world landmark (like Mount Rainier, as used in this tutorial) from elevation data, prepare it in slicer software, and produce a physical model. This hands-on process helps visualize geological features and topography for educational purposes, and in this case is for students at Pierce College utilizing Makerspace resources.

The primary goal is to connect students with Pierce College's Makerspace and its capabilities.

## Target Audience & Course Relevance
This project is tailored for students in the following Pierce College geology courses:
* GEOL 107 Exploring Earth Science (5 credits)
* GEOL 112 Geohazards and Natural Disasters (5 credits)
* GEOL& 101 Introduction to Physical Geology (5 credits)
* GEOL& 103 Historical Geology (5 credits)
* GEOL& 110 Environmental Geology (5 credits)
* GEOL& 115 Geology National Parks (5 credits)

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, students will gain experience in:
* Creating physical models to visualize geological concepts.
* Utilizing Maker Space resources effectively.
* 3D modeling and terrain generation from elevation data (e.g., using Terrain2STL).
* 3D printing principles and operation of slicer software (e.g., Prusaslicer).
* Model preparation, scaling, and orientation for successful printing.
* 3D print post-processing and finishing techniques.

## Features
* Detailed step-by-step guide for creating a 3D topographical model.
* Uses readily available online tools like Terrain2STL.
* Focuses on practical application with common slicer software (Prusaslicer).
* Emphasizes hands-on learning for geological education.
* Provides guidance on utilizing Pierce College Makerspace resources, including alternative print submission methods (e.g., QR code portal).

## Materials Required
* Access to a 3D Printer (specifically from the Pierce College Maker Space).
* A computer with internet access.
* Slicer Software (e.g., Prusaslicer).
* A landmark you wish to model (Mount Rainier is used as the primary example).

## Process Overview
The general workflow involves:
1.  **Landmark Selection:** Choose a geographical feature to model (e.g., Mount Rainier).
2.  **Data Acquisition:** Use a tool like Terrain2STL to define the location and model area, then generate and download the STL file.
3.  **File Preparation:** Extract the STL file.
4.  **Slicing:** Import the STL into slicer software (e.g., Prusaslicer).
    * Resize and orient the model.
    * Configure infill, support (if needed), and filament settings.
    * Slice the model to generate G-code.
5.  **Printing:**
    * Export G-code to the 3D printer.
    * Prepare the 3D printer (e.g., bed leveling).
    * Start and monitor the print.
6.  **Post-Processing:**
    * Troubleshoot any print issues.
    * Remove the model from the print bed and clean up any supports.
    * Optional finishing touches (painting, smoothing).

## Resources Used

* **Terrain2STL:** For generating STL files from elevation data.
* **Prusaslicer:** Slicer software for preparing models for 3D printing.
* **Pierce College Makerspace:** For access to 3D printers and support.
* **Course Syllabi:** For curriculum context (see course list above).
